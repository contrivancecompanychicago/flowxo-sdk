# Using Grunt with a FlowXO Service

The Grunt Task runner is a really simple way of performing tasks.

The [gruntfile.js](https://github.com/flowxo/flowxo-services-google-sheets-example/blob/master/gruntfile.js) has a number of useful tasks that you can run from your command line.

Make sure your current working directory is at the location of the gruntfile.js

```
grunt init
```
